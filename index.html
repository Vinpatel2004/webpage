            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <img src = "images/myself.jpg" alt="profile" class="profile-pic">
            <p> Hello! My name is Vin Patel, and I am currently a student at Umass Lowell.
            Pursuing Computer Science degree. I got interested in this pathway as I 
            grew through my childhood surrounded by technology and made me hook to it
            and here I am following the pathway in becoming a software developer. Through
            each semester I am improving my skills in coding, and now by taking this course
            it's my first step toward becoming a front-end developer. Before, I had never worked with
            html or css; In high school only did javaScript but it wasn't much just touched the
            surface. So, I'm Hoping to get more experience with GUI.

        <h2>My extra interests</h2>
        <div class = "A2">
            <p> Alongside becoming a developer, I am passionate about cooking, fitness, exploring
            new technology, traveling, and cars. I also love binge movies and shows when I am
            not coding. While on campus, when I don't have classes or homework, I spend time
            with my friends at the recreation center; playing pool or gym for exercise. My favorite 
            cooking cuisines are Indian, Mexican, and Italian. For movies, I like more patriotic,
            thriller, and comedy. Additionally, as for sports my favorite is volleyball and cricket,
            as a routine on weekends, it is set to play outside or indoor either one of the sports.</p>
